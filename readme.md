# Fake News Detection Using BERT

I started a toy project to gain a better understanding of Bert. 

In this project, I used the "fake-news-detection-dataset-english" dataset to classify fake news. By using a pretrained Bert-based model on this dataset, I developed a model that could effectively distinguish between real and fake news articles. 

This project allowed me to explore the capabilities of Bert in natural language processing tasks and gain insights into its performance in the context of fake news detection.
